# Evolution-Path-of-Stars
A star evolves through many stages. It's temperature changes and so does its luminosity with these stages. A nice way therefore, to study stars, is to plot their luminosity and temperature at every stage. Such a plot is called a Hertzsprungâ€“Russell (HR) diagram. In this repository I take data of the globular star cluster M3 of NGC5272.
